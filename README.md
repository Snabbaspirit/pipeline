# pipeline


Pipeline in Jenkins is a group of jobs (or events) that are interlinked in a particular sequence. Jenkins Pipeline is a set or suite of plugins that provides support for implementation and integration of Continuous Delivery pipelines into Jenkins.

The Pipeline also provides a set of tools that are useful for modeling simple as well as complex delivery pipelines ‘as code’ through ‘Pipeline Domain-Specific Language (DSL)’ syntax.

Every job in the Jenkins pipeline has some dependency on one or more events. Continuous delivery pipeline in Jenkins consists of four states – Build, Deploy, Test, and Release. Each of these states consist of events that execute in a sequence.
